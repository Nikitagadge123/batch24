1]what is network topology ?                                    8] Dora Process :- it is technique used by DHCP to dynamically assing IP address
ans :- multiple newtworks devices are connected to each other                      to any device over the internet
   1)BUS Topology 
   2)Ring Topology                                              9] Firewall :- is a network security system that monitors & controlls incoming & 
   3)Star Topology                                                             outgoing traffic based on the set of rules (ex- internet) 
   4)Mesh Topology                                                             there are 2 type 1)host based firewall 2)network based firewall
   5)Tree Topology
   6)Hybrid Topology

2] Mac address ?
ans :- 1] Mac address is also called as physical address
       2] it is globally unique address 
       3] it is 48 bit address 
       4] it is represent in hexa decimal formate
       5] it is work on the data link layer of OSI Model

3] what is subneting ?
ans :- 1] it is network inside network 
       2] subnet make network more efficient 
       3] we csn use the host bit into network ID 
       4] by using subneting we can avoid awstage of host bit 

4] what is IP address ?
ans :- it is internet protocall it is unique address that identifies devices on the internet 

5] what is networking ?
ans :- it is the exchange of information through network . it is medium for transfer the data 

6] Multiplexing & Dmultiplexing ?
ans :- 1]it is process of combining multiple signals into one signal that travels on medium 
       2]demultiplexing is reverse of multiplexing in which multiple signals are divide into individual signals
 
7] Gates in networking ?
ans :- it is building block of a digital system & an electronic circuit that always have one output 
       types of logical gate are 1] AND gate 2]OR gate 3]NOT gate 4]NAND gate 5]NOR gate 6]XOR gate 7]XNOR gate
